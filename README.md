## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To develop a comprehensive Python program capable of interacting with multiple AI tools through APIs (such as OpenAI, Hugging Face, Google PaLM, etc.) to automate prompt-based queries. The goal is to compare the responses across platforms and generate insights based on response quality, contextual accuracy, and usefulness.

## ðŸ“š Concepts Covered

- Prompt Engineering
- Python Programming
- API Integration (REST APIs)
- JSON Data Handling
- NLP Response Evaluation
- Comparative Metrics
- Insight Generation

## ðŸ“‹ Algorithm

### Step 1: Setup the Environment
- Install Python libraries: `requests`, `json`, `dotenv` (for environment variables).
- Store and load API keys securely using environment variables.

### Step 2: Define Prompt and AI Tool Endpoints
- Create a common input prompt for testing.
- Store API URLs and configurations for each AI tool.

### Step 3: Implement API Functions
- Create Python functions to interact with:
  - OpenAI
  - Hugging Face
  - Google PaLM (or other tools)
- Send the same prompt to all platforms.

### Step 4: Collect Responses
- Retrieve responses from each AI model.
- Parse the results into a standardized structure.

### Step 5: Analyze and Compare Outputs
- Evaluate the outputs based on:
  - Clarity
  - Relevance
  - Creativity/Depth
- Use string similarity metrics (optional: cosine similarity).

### Step 6: Generate Comparative Report
- Summarize results in tabular or bullet form.
- Indicate which model performed best in specific metrics.

### Step 7: Output and Logging
- Display the best response.
- Save comparison results to a file (optional: JSON/CSV).
